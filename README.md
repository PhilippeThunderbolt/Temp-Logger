# Temp Logger
 Use and Arduino and Data Logging Shield to store readings from 2 SH31 temp sensors.

Quite a simple project here, and just wanted to understand the delta between inside and
outside my Shiftpod XL while camping in the desert.

Pretty self explanatory, and also included a SH31 test program
